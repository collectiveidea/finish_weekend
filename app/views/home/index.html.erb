  We've all heard of startup weekends. Many of us have participated in one. Coming up with a new idea is easy, so is getting started. Finishing is hard. Finish Weekend helps you get it done. Come finish those projects you've put off to the side. Maybe you just need a bit of web help, a logo, or some code written. <span>We'll help you finish.</span>

    <p>Something that can be released in a weekend. Not a final version, but something to get it in front of people. Maybe you've been coding up a killer app, but need help building a website to announce it. Maybe you have a nasty bug you need help with. Maybe you need some copy written. Maybe you just need a few hours of encouragement. We'll get your project polished up and ready to go.<br>Bring a project, and get ready to ship it!</p>
