    <p>Something that can be released in a weekend. Not a final version, but something to get it in front of people. Maybe you've been coding up a killer app, but need help building a website to announce it. Maybe you have a nasty bug you need help with. Maybe you need some copy written. Maybe you just need a few hours of encouragement. We'll get your project polished up and ready to go.<br>Bring a project, and get ready to ship it!</p>
